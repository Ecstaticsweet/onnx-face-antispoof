# ONNX Face Anti-Spoof Benchmark

This file is generated by `benchmark.py`. Run:

```bash
python benchmark.py
```

The script will probe CPU/CUDA/DirectML providers, benchmark the detector and liveness models, and overwrite this report with mean/p50/p95 latency plus FPS per provider. Values are based on synthetic inputs so you can compare devices consistently.
